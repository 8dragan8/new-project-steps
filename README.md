# Steps for new project

## Renaming the Local master Branch to main
The first step is to rename the "master" branch in your local Git repositories:
```
$ git branch -m master main
```
Let's quickly check if this has worked as expected:
```
$ git status
```
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
